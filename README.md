## How this works

- Bitcoins can be stored in [bitcoin wallets](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet).
- Every wallet has an [address in the form of a hash](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/bitcoin-address).
- Every wallet is public and can be viewed here on this address: https://blockchain.info/rawaddr/<wallet-address>, for example  [https://blockchain.info/rawaddr/1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2]
